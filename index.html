        1] <b>React & Features</b> - Created by <u> Jordan Walke </u>, software
        engineer in FB , and first deployed in the FB Newsfeed and later in
        Whatsapp & Instagram. <br />
        It is an open source library developed by facebook in 2011. It is used
        to create <u>single page applications</u> by following component based
        approach by creating <u>reusable UI components</u> . It is used for
        developing interactive view layer of web and mobile applications. <br />
        Features of react include: <br />
        i) Virtual DOM <br />
        ii) JSX <br />
        iii) Components which can be reused. <br />
        iv) One way data Binding <br />
        v) Good community support <br />
        vi) Easy learning curve

        <b>Virtual DOM</b> - Whenever an application gets loaded in the browser
        a Document Object Model is created, In which each element is treated as
        an object. When a react application is loaded and the react components
        are mounted, virtual dom is created. It is a
        <u>lightweight copy of the actual DOM</u>. <br />
        When any user makes changes which leads to state updation, the changes
        will go to virtual dom. <br />
        React has two virtual dom, one virtual dom gets created at the time of
        mounting of react component so it is a copy of your real dom. Another
        virtual dom is the dom which contains the new changes, updated state
        variables values. Now these two virtual doms will get compared with each
        other and will check for the new changes. this complete procedure is
        known as <u>diffing algorithm</u>. Now the new changes will be updated
        in your Real dom. this procedure is known as <u>Recoinciliation</u>.

      <li>
        <b>Diffing Algorithm</b> - Whenever there is a change in the state of
        the UI elements, a new virtual DOM is created. Then the new virtual DOM
        and the previous <u>virtual DOM are compared</u> with each other. This
        comparing is called DOM diffing.
      </li>

        <b>React Vs Vue Vs Angular</b> - React is a <u>JS Library</u>. Library
        is a set of reusable functions used by computer programs. Framework is a
        piece of code that dictates the architecture of a project. <br />
        Library is called by the code, but in framework, framework calls the
        code. We can control the data flow in library using methods, but in
        framework we do not have any control over the data flow. It decides the
        data flow which is nothing but it calls the code. Performance-wise ,
        React is much much better than Angular and Vue. br React has an
        <u>easy learning curve</u>, and it helps to make <u>SPA</u>. It consists
        of <u>Virtual DOM</u> and It has a <u>great community support</u> which
        means that whenever you get stuck somewhere, you can get solutions to
        your code almost instantly.

        <b>Functional Vs Class Components</b> - i) Class Components uses
        <u>lifecycle methods</u> while Functional Components use <u>hooks</u>.
        <br />
        ii) Class Components are called <u>stateful components</u> and
        Functional Components are called <u>stateless components</u>. <br />
        iii) <u>render function</u> in Class Components is present, while
        Functional Components only consists of <u>return</u>. <br />
        iv)Class Components accept <u>state and props</u> both, while Functional
        Components accepts <u>only props</u> as an argument. <br />
        v) Class Components have <u>complex code structure</u> which can be hard
        to read and write while Functional Components are
        <u>simple to use</u> and easy to read and write. <br />
        vi) <u>this keyword</u> is used in Class Components but not in
        Functional Components.

      <li>
        <b>Stateful Vs Stateless Components</b> - In React, a stateful component
        is a component that <u>holds some state</u>.They are also called
        <u>smart components/Class Components</u>.They can be reused.
        <br />
        Stateless components, by contrast, have <u>no state</u>. Both types of
        components can use props. They are also called
        <u>dumb components/Functional Components</u> and are easy to
        understand.They do not work with react lifecycle.
      </li>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <li>
        <b>Phases of React component Lifecycle</b> - In ReactJS, every component
        creation process involves various lifecycle methods. These lifecycle
        methods are termed as <u>component's lifecycle</u>. These lifecycle
        methods are not very complicated and called at various points during a
        component's life. The lifecycle of the component is divided into four
        phases. They are: <br />
        <u>Initial Phase</u> <br />
        <u>Mounting Phase</u> <br />
        <u>Updating Phase</u> <br />
        <u>Unmounting Phase</u> <br />
        Each phase contains some lifecycle methods that are specific to the
        particular phase
